We are literally planning the next event(s) right now. The topic will be **`Real World Data'**, i.e. data collected outside the laboratory. This includes big health data collections as well as demographic data but is not limited to these two examples.
How can we analyse these data sets? What are the chances and limitations of these data sets? Does collecting this data collide with our privacy?
