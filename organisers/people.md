The organisation team consists of researchers working at different academic and industry institutions spanning over the Basel area. We combine our organisation meetings with a good lunch or a beer in one of the _Buvetten_. Read more about the organisers of the seminar here.

In his research, Carsten develops mathematical models to study biologically relevant questions concerning HIV dynamics and evolution. You will find more information on his research [here][link Carsten] or write an email to <carsten.magnus@bsse.ethz.ch>.

Beyond academia, Liza is a hackathons frequent flyer, where her titles alternate between a participant, a winner, a jury member and an organiser [www.hackandlead.com][link HackNLead]. She is a passionate community builder, currently concentrating efforts around increasing diversity in STEM [www.womenplusplus.ch][link wpp].
