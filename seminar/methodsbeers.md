subtitle: Bringing together scientist from academia and industry.

<img align="left" src="/img/MBlogo.jpg" style="width: 200px;" hspace="15px"/> _Methods & Beers_ series is a meeting of people from institutions in the Basel area with an interest in data analysis methods. We come together, exchange ideas, and have a beer and snack. It is an intentionally informal, participant driven meeting; we believe this gives a good environment for lively discussions and exchange of ideas.
We cover fields that are interesting for both academic research and research in industry.

We believe that a seminar becomes the more attractive and beneficial to all participants the more all participants are involved in the discussion. Thus, we organise unusual setups that go far beyond common seminar structures. This includes:
 - __Slide carousels__ in which each participant presents their ideas in one minute with one slide
 - **short talks** with the same length of discussion time
 - **World Caf√© style discussions**
 - **hackathons**
