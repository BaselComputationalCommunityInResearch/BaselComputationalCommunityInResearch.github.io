### Next meeting


#### Methods and Beers 9 ####
The next *Methods and Beers* seminar will be on November 22nd, 2018.
The topic will be **`Real World Data'**, i.e. data collected outside the laboratory. This includes big health data collections as well as demographic data but is not limited to these two examples.
How can we analyse these data sets? What are the chances and limitations of these data sets? Does collecting this data collide with our privacy?
 Please [contact us][link contact] if you want to give a talk or if you are eager to lead a discussion.
